# Freedom: v4.0 #

Welcome to Freedom: v4.0

FreeedomMod is a custom made plugin by Savnith and it removes most of the stuff that says "TotalFreedom" or "TotalFreedomMod" this plugin is good to use for a server with no custom plugins.
This was made for BanterFreedom: Remastered till no one could pay the bill so now its just a normal Freedom Plugin!

## TotalFreedomMod ##
TotalFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the [Official TotalFreedom Minecraft Server](http://totalfreedom.me/). However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.

This plugin was originally coded by StevenLawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (Prozza) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later. It consists of over 85+ custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main TotalFreedom server, TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.
